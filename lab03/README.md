Lab 3:
Weathered Dad Jokes uses the OpenWeather API and a API from a dad joke website. Depending 
on the weather I find dad jokes related to the weather. 

The biggest stuggle was figuring how to use the API since its been long time since I last
used one. Otherwise it was pretty easy since it was just basic HTML and CSS. There is a
part which is unrefined since the randomizer I use to go through a array of key words isn't 
large it often returns the same joke even after clicking the Get Joke button again.
