When I started formatting my website I had no idea of how I wanted to design my page. While rereading the instructions 
I decided that using a table like the directions mentioned 
would be a good method to display everything. The formatting
would be clean and organized, easily legible, and would be 
reminicent of online food apps. It has been a while since I last
used a table in HTML so I had to seek out sources to help me, 
which I have linked below. 

After filling out the table I then focused on the CSS. I wanted 
my website to have more color so I found a color palette I liked 
and applied them to my site. With most of my page done I realised 
it was a bit plain so I decided to add a search feature. It takes 
in words and finds the dish with those words in the name, cuisine,
or ingredients. It however doesn't work for the category or 
description of a dish. If this was to make a full restaurant app
I would add a filter option for cuisine and category to account 
for dietary needs and preferences but since the site only has 
four dishes it did not seem necessary. I also wanted it to be 
easy to see which dish the user is looking at so I made the 
background color of the table change if the mouse was hovering on 
it. I debated on making teach dish clickable and having their own 
page but seemed to beyond the scope of the quiz so the idea was
scrapped.
