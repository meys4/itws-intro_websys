Weather Color Palette generates different color palletes depending on the weather. 

This lab explored the limitations of Generative AI. This website was all made by ChatGPT. 
There was minimal setbacks with the code but formatting and presentation of the wepage became a issue.

List of my Prompts in into ChatGPT:
1. use open weather api and https://www.thecolorapi.com/ to create a website that generates color palates based on the weather
2. please split it into seperate files
3. use https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather
4. display the weather
5. why does the get weather not work
6. add the names of the colors to the page
7. return the temp in F not C
8. the temperature is wrong 
9. make the code account for the time of day as well when it comes to generating colors
10. return all the code in its respective file
11. generate at least 3 different palletes to pick from
12. display the palletes horizontally

 Generate Palette
27. after the button is clicked center all the content at the top of the page
28. return all the css
29. return the fixed code for generate function
30. make the color swatches bigger and make it possible to put in another city after
31. Error: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'style')
32. now the color swatches arent displaying
33. fix the weather text box since it is still off center ad slightly skewed right
34. the box is till skewed can you see why it is off center
35. ![alt text](image.png) this is what i mean by the displayed weather box is skewed. also pls make the box around 30% smaller
36. set the weather box width to be the same as the entire color palette
37. provide all the css 
38. have the initial Weather → Color Palette
