Lab 6:
1. Each class represents a math operation. The Operation class 
defines the structure and subclasses. When a button is clicked, 
the form sends a POST request, and the script checks which 
button was pressed, creating that object, and produces the 
result. The operate() function does the calculation and 
getEquation() formats the output. Errors are shown when caught.
2. If $_GET were used instead, the input values and chosen 
operation would be shown in the URL instead of in the request 
body. This makes the operation bookmarkable but less secure and 
tidy. 
3. A better way to see which button was clicked is to give them 
the same name but different values. You can use a mapping 
statement to get the operation class instead of if statements. 

Part 1 of the lab was fairly simple, change the operations and 
the formatting for each operation. Afterwards, when I ran the 
code I found that it didn't display so I went throught the 
code again and found part 2 and finished it. It was simple 
since the only change needed was the names which were already 
in the file. There was a bit of confusion since I didn't know
that was part 2 when i went back to look for it and thought
there was another section I missed.
